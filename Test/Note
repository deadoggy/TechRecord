Lecture 2 Fundamental

  Testing in waterfall --- disadvantage: testing is just a one time action
  Testing in general V model --- Constructive activities are decomposed from testing

  Fundamental testing process:

  Begin -> Planning and Control-> Analysis&Design -> Impl & Exec -> Evaluation of Exit Criteria and Reporting -> ?


                                 control

  Planning & Control

    Intensity of test depends on -- Test tech used & Test coverage

    Prioritization of tests -- Critical parts first


  Analysis & Design

    First task -- review the test basis
    Check testability
    Ensure traceability bet specifications and tests

    test cases from target's specification(BB) & source code(WB)

    for each case:
        initial situation -- environment & expected result

    type  -- for expected input
          -- for unexpected input

  Implementation & Execution

    cases --> group(scenario)
    Recommendation: smoke test --> start test with examination of functionality
    Logged -- comprehensible  provable
    Reproducibility -- testware subjected to configuration management

  Evaluation & Reporting

    test exit criteria
    whether need  further effort
    failure rate
    after repaired, new tests needed -- plan test cycles
    in practice, end of a test is often defined by time and cost
    summary report
