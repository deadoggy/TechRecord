Lecture 2 Fundamental

  Testing in waterfall --- disadvantage: testing is just a one time action
  Testing in general V model --- Constructive activities are decomposed from testing

  Fundamental testing process:

  Begin -> Planning and Control-> Analysis&Design -> Impl & Exec -> Evaluation of Exit Criteria and Reporting -> Closure Activity
                ^                        ^             ^                                |                               |
                |______________________ ____________|________________________________|_______________________________|
                                         |             |                                |
                                         |_____________|________________________________|

  Planning & Control

    Intensity of test depends on -- Test tech used & Test coverage

    Prioritization of tests -- Critical parts first


  Analysis & Design

    First task -- review the test basis
    Check testability
    Ensure traceability bet specifications and tests

    test cases from target's specification(BB) & source code(WB)

    for each case:
        initial situation -- environment & expected result

    type  -- for expected input
          -- for unexpected input

  Implementation & Execution

    cases --> group(scenario)
    Recommendation: smoke test --> start test with examination of functionality
    Logged -- comprehensible  provable
    Reproducibility -- testware subjected to configuration management

  Evaluation & Reporting

    test exit criteria
    whether need  further effort
    failure rate
    after repaired, new tests needed -- plan test cycles
    in practice, end of a test is often defined by time and cost
    summary report

  Test Closure Act
    logs
    ...


  Principles:
  1.shows the presence of defect
  2.Exhaustive testing is impossible
  3.start as early as possible
  4.defect clustering
  5.pesticide paradox （杀虫剂悖论）
  6.content dependent
  7.No failures means  sys is useful   is a fallacy(谬误)

Lecture 3

  General V-Model:
    Development -- testing : corresponding ; equal importance; parallel;
    left - develop
    right- test

    validation   -- do the right thing : make sure outcomes meet the requirement
    verification -- thing is done correctly

  Component Test:

    If white box applied, source code can be analyzed

    characters:
      components are tested individually isolated from other components, necessary to prevent external influences
        EX:Stored procedure
    Component could be a unit composed of other components -- only examine internal aspect

    Test environment
    Test driver:  case study
    framework : JUnit .....
